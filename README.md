# NERC - nexrender configurer

Tool for generating nexrender configs out of Magento product export.

**Note:** This is wery much work in progress...

## Getting started

1. Download `nerc` executable from releases
2. Place `products.csv` to the same directory as the `nerc` executable
3. Execute the `nerc`
4. You should now have bunch of nexrender configs in a new `/output` directory
